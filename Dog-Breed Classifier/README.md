In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your 
algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling 
dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, you will make important design decisions about the user experience 
for your app. By completing this lab, you demonstrate your understanding of the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models 
designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.
