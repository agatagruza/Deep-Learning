In this project, you'll define and train a **Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)** on a dataset of faces. Your goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from **loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks**. At the end of the notebook, you'll be able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; your generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
