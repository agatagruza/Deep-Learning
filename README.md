## [PROJECT 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/agatagruza/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Predicting%20Bike-Sharing%20Patterns)
Built and trained neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

## [PROJECT 2: Dog-Breed Classifier](https://github.com/agatagruza/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Dog-Breed%20Classifier)
Designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds. Used transfer learning and well-known architectures to improve this model. 

## [PROJECT 3: Generate TV scripts](https://github.com/agatagruza/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Generate%20TV%20Scripts)
Built a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on TensorFlow to process text. Used it to generate new episodes of my favorite TV show, based on old scripts.

## [PROJECT 4: Generate Faces](https://github.com/agatagruza/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Generate%20Faces)
Built a pair of multi-layer neural networks and made them compete against each other in order to generate new, realistic faces. Used Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) for image generation.

## [PROJECT 5: Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model](https://github.com/agatagruza/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Deploying%20a%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Model)
Trained and deployed my own PyTorch sentiment analysis model using Amazon's SageMaker service. Built a model and created a gateway for accessing it from a website.
