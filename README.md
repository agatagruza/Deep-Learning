# Deep-Learning
Deep Learning is a repo for projects built as a part of [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://imp.i115008.net/7ZNNr?ref=oscarleo.com) that was offered by AWS and Facebook AI. To be selectected, 1st you needed to compete with 6000 students in Secure and Private AI Challenge Scholarship  to get a spot in  "Deep Learning" Nanodegree. Only 300 students were selected for Nanondegree.  
> Out of six thousand students in the [Secure and Private AI Challenge Scholarship](https://github.com/agatagruza/private-ai), your progress in the course and dedication in the community really stood out. We’ve been impressed and we’re excited for you to continue the journey and grow even stronger as a developer. 


## [PROJECT 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/agatagruza/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Predicting%20Bike-Sharing%20Patterns)
Built and trained neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

## [PROJECT 2: Dog-Breed Classifier](https://github.com/agatagruza/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Dog-Breed%20Classifier)
Designed and trained a __*convolutional neural network (CNN)*__ to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds. Used transfer learning and well-known architectures to improve this model. 

## [PROJECT 3: Generate TV scripts](https://github.com/agatagruza/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Generate%20TV%20Scripts)
Built a __*Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)*__ on TensorFlow to process text. Used it to generate new episodes of my favorite TV show, based on old scripts.

## [PROJECT 4: Generate Faces](https://github.com/agatagruza/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Generate%20Faces)
Built a pair of multi-layer neural networks and made them compete against each other in order to generate new, realistic faces. Used Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) for image generation.

## [PROJECT 5: Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model](https://github.com/agatagruza/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Deploying%20a%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Model)
Trained and deployed my own PyTorch sentiment analysis model using __*Amazon's SageMaker*__ service. Built a model and created a gateway for accessing it from a website.
